1.Introduction

Electric vehicles (EVs) have gained significant attention in recent years as an alternative to
traditional internal combustion engine vehicles due to their positive impact on the
environment, reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, and potential to decrease dependency on
fossil fuels. Globally, governments and automotive industries have shown increased interest in
developing and promoting electric mobility, and Turkey is no exception.
In Turkey, electric vehicle adoption has been notably accelerated due to governmental
incentives, the expansion of charging infrastructure, and rising environmental awareness
among consumers. This report aims to analyze the trend of electric vehicle sales in Turkey
over the past five years (2019-2024), investigate the factors influencing this growth, and
provide forecasts for future trends.
The data utilized in this study was primarily gathered from reliable sources such as the
Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK) and Automotive Distributors and Mobility Association
(ODMD), ensuring the accuracy and credibility of the analysis. The outcomes of this report
will not only highlight the growth trajectory of the electric vehicle market in Turkey but also
offer valuable insights for policymakers, businesses, and consumers involved in the
automotive industry.
